# Installation

To install DarkGlass you’ll need Perl, Python, Git and ImageMagick
installed.

You will also need the following Perl packages: CGI.pm, File::Slurp, File::MimeInfo, Image::ExifTool, DateTime, HTML::Tiny, XML::LibXSLT, XML::Atom, PDF::API2.

Then run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/rrthomas/DarkGlass
cd DarkGlass
./install.sh /PATH/TO/YOUR/DOCUMENT-ROOT /PATH/TO/YOUR/CGI-BIN
```

(You can use the same `install.sh` command to update a DarkGlass
installation with a newer version; beware though that this overwrites files
you may have edited, such as `web.pl`, so you should take a copy before you
upgrade.)

Then, configure the `web.pl` script as described in [Configuration](Configuration.md).

The input files correspond directly to output files. Web pages are written
as Markdown files, whose contents is then templated into the structure given
by the `view.html` template file, which you can customize as desired. Other
resources such as media files, CSS (including DarkGlass’s own `style.css`)
and any web server configuration files, are rendered verbatim. See [How output is generated from input](How output is generated from input.md) for more details.

Depending on whether you want to use DarkGlass statically or dynamically, see the [Static sites](Static sites.md) or [Dynamic sites](Dynamic sites.md).

The site should now be ready to use. See [Testing](Testing.md) for how to test it in dynamic mode without configuring a web server.

Then, see [Customization](Customization.md) for details of the various ways in which DarkGlass can be customized.

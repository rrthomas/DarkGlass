DarkGlass is derived from my wiki, [Wiklet](http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/Wiklet), whose early versions were based on [DolphinWiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20051025080507/http://www.object-arts.co.uk:80/wiki/html/Dolphin/FrontPage.htm), which in turn was derived from the original [WikiWikiWeb](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki). Alistair Turnbull gave invaluable criticism, as ever.

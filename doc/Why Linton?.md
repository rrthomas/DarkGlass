# Why Linton?

_Why is Linton a good thing?_

Most ways of putting up a web site require you to copy content to the web server manually, often in a different format from that in which you authored it. This may be OK if your content is web-only, but if you want to reuse pieces in other forms (e.g. in print or as standalone documents), then you may have to maintain multiple versions.

Linton takes the approach that a personal web site should just be a subset of one’s personal files (“My Documents” or “home directory” or whatever). It uses file permissions to control which files are displayed, and which not. It allows a variety of file types (plain text, images, HTML, MP3s, LaTeX) to be displayed, and others to be downloaded. It allows pages to be written simply as plain text using Markdown.

Linton is flexible, but simple. It has a single HTML template to control the look of the site. The navigation bar by default displays a simplified directory listing, but can be overridden in each directory. For users who prefer to publish a web site in a more conventional way, Linton can generate a separate set of files for a web server.

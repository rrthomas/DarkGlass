# Testing

DarkGlass comes with a simple web server written in
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for testing. You need Node installed to use
it.

To set it up, run:

```
npm install
```

Then to launch the server, run:

```
node /PATH/TO/YOUR/CGI-BIN/server.js
```

The script will find an unused port on localhost, and print a message
telling you what port it is running on.

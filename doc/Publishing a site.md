## Publishing a site

To publish a Linton web site, run the following command:

```
/PATH/TO/BIN/linton publish /PATH/TO/BIN/web.pl /PATH/TO/OUTPUT
```

Here, `web.pl` is the configuration script for Linton, and the `OUTPUT`
path is where the files for your web server go.

You can add the `--verbose` flag to the command to show its progress; for
more information, run: `/PATH/TO/BIN/linton publish --help`.

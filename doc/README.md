# DarkGlass

DarkGlass is a simple content management system, a program that runs on a web server to provide a web site from a collection of files providing the content. The overall look of the site is controlled by HTML templates. DarkGlass pages can be written as HTML or Markdown.

DarkGlass can either be used as a CGI script to generate web pages dynamically, or you can generate sites statically.

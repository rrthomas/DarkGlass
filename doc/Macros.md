# Macros

Macros are special markup which add functionality to DarkGlass. A macro call is written `\$macro` if the macro takes no arguments, or `\$macro{arg_1_,â€¦,arg_n_}` if it does. Commas in macro arguments must be escaped with backslashes. Unwanted arguments may be omitted.

Macros are evaluated after Markdown is converted to HTML.

FIXME: Documentation of some macros is missing. The documentation should really be extracted from the code.

=`\$page`=
    The site-relative path of the current page.

    The name of the current page (the last path component of `\$page`).

    Make a URL from a site-relative path.

# DarkGlass Organization

## Distribution

The [distribution archive](Getting DarkGlass.md) is organised as follows:

=`README`=
    is a quick introduction.
=`cgi-bin`=
    contains the main DarkGlass program `DarkGlass.pm`, some helper modules in `VCS` and `RRT`, and the front-end script and configuration file `wiki.pl`.
=`*.md`
    The DarkGlass documentation.

## URLs

DarkGlass’s use of URLs mirrors the structure of the files it uses on disk, but almost all URLs within the wiki are generated by [macros](DarkGlass Macros) such as a link to a file or image.
